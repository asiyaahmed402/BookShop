Hello,

Thanks again for reaching out to [our company] to suggest [the new feature they proposed].

Unfortunately, although we love the idea, we aren’t able to add it to our development calendar at this point due to competing priorities. If or when that changes, we’ll reach out with more information. 

We appreciate your insight and suggestions. Keep sending them our way!
