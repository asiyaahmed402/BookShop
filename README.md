# E-MailGeneration System
This is an E-mail Generation System for a company has the following categories of customers, Business, Returning, Frequent, New and VIP
customers. The management of the company needs to send to their customers personalize emails
based on the customer types. The company need to have an application that generates emails from
a base template for different types of customers


# Features
This program was built using the abstract factory pattern which is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
This pattern fulfills the design goals, reusability and correctness. 

This program also "attempts" to use the singleton pattern

##Details 
-Abstract Products declare abstract classes for a set of distinct but related products which make up a product family.
-Concrete Products are various implementations of abstract products, grouped by variants.
-The BuildTheFactories interface declares a set of methods for creating each of the abstract products.
-Concrete Factories implement creation methods of the abstract factory. Each concrete factory corresponds to a specific variant of products and creates only those product variants.
-though concrete factories instantiate concrete products, signatures of their creation methods must return corresponding abstract products. This way the client code that uses a factory doesnâ€™t get coupled to the specific variant of the product it gets from a factory. The Client can work with any concrete factory/product variant, as long as it communicates with their objects via abstract interfaces.

##Future
-Fix the singleton class
-Refactor code to lessen repeated code

# How to run

```bash
mvn -q clean compile exec:java -Dexec.executable="edu.bu.met.cs665.Main" -Dlog4j.configuration="file:log4j.properties"
```

We recommand the above command for running the project. 

Alternativly, you can run the following command. It will generate a single jar file with all of the dependencies. 

```bash
mvn clean compile assembly:single

java -Dlog4j.configuration=file:log4j.properties -classpath ./target/JavaProjectTemplate-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar  edu.bu.met.cs665.Main
```


# Run all the unit test classes.


```bash
mvn clean compile test

```

# Using Findbugs 

To see bug detail using the Findbugs GUI, use the following command "mvn findbugs:gui"

Or you can create a XML report by using  


```bash
mvn findbugs:gui 
```

or 


```bash
mvn findbugs:findbugs
```


For more info about FindBugs see 

http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/

And about Maven Findbug plugin see 
https://gleclaire.github.io/findbugs-maven-plugin/index.html


You can install Findbugs Eclipse Plugin 

http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/manual/eclipse.html



SpotBugs https://spotbugs.github.io/ is the spiritual successor of FindBugs.


# Run Checkstyle 

CheckStyle code styling configuration files are in config/ directory. Maven checkstyle plugin is set to use google code style. 
You can change it to other styles like sun checkstyle. 

To analyze this example using CheckStyle run 

```bash
mvn checkstyle:check
```

This will generate a report in XML format


```bash
target/checkstyle-checker.xml
target/checkstyle-result.xml
```

and the following command will generate a report in HTML format that you can open it using a Web browser. 

```bash
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
```

```bash
target/site/checkstyle.html
```


# Generate  coveralls:report
